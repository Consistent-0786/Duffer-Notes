## Detecting Brute Forcing Attacks
Analyzing brute force attacks can help you understand the methods used by attackers and identify vulnerabilities in your security controls. To do this, you should **collect and store** authentication logs from your web application, including the successful logins as well as the failed login attempts. Look for **patterns of suspicious activity** in the authentication logs, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a **particular IP address** or user account. **Analyze network traffic logs** to identify patterns of traffic that may be associated with brute force attacks, such as repeated login attempts from the same IP address or requests to non-existent pages or directories.Â 

Deploy an **intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion prevention system (IPS)** to analyze network traffic and detect signs of brute force attacks. **Look for common attack vectors** used in brute force attacks, such as dictionary attacks or password spraying. Identify user accounts that are vulnerable to brute force attacks due to weak passwords or other vulnerabilities. Finally, monitor for incidents of brute force attacks and respond to them promptly **by blocking malicious IP addresses**, locking out user accounts, and implementing additional security controls as necessary. By following these steps, you can strengthen your security controls and reduce the risk of successful brute force attacks.
### Example 
- Example Nginx log file that contains Brute Force attack:

- To detect brute force attacks in nginx log files, you can use various tools and techniques such as:
	**Log analysis tools:** There are several log analysis tools such as Logstash, ElasticSearch, and Kibana (ELK Stack) that can help you analyze nginx log files and detect brute force attacks. These tools will allow you to search for specific patterns in the log files, such as repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or user agent.
	**Regular expressions:** Regular expressions can be used to search for specific patterns in the log files. For example, you can use a regular expression to match a sequence of repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or user agent.

==Things that you can do after the detection==

**Fail2ban:** Fail2ban is a popular intrusion prevention tool that can be used to automatically block the IP addresses that are detected as engaging in brute force attacks. Fail2ban works by monitoring the nginx log files and applying predefined filters to detect and block suspicious activity.
**IP blocking:** You can manually block IP addresses that are detected as engaging in brute force attacks by adding them to the nginx configuration file. For example, you can use the deny rule to block traffic from specific IP addresses:

## Prevention Methods for Brute Forcing
**Implement CAPTCHA:** Use CAPTCHA or other bot detection mechanisms to detect automated login attempts and prevent them from succeeding.

**Limit the rate of login attempts:** Implement a mechanism that limits the number of login attempts that can be made within a certain time period (e.g. 5 login attempts per minute). This will slow down brute force attacks, as the attacker will need to wait between attempts.

**Use multi-factor authentication:** Require users to provide additional authentication factors, such as a one-time code sent via SMS or email, in addition to their username and password.

**Monitoring login attempts:** This involves monitoring login attempts for signs of suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address, or unusual spikes in traffic or requests. This can help to detect and prevent brute force attacks before they are successful.

**Using strong passwords and password policies:** This involves requiring users to choose strong passwords that are difficult to guess, and enforcing password policies that require users to change their passwords regularly and prohibiting the use of weak or easily guessable passwords.
