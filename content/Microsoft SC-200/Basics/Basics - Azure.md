# Azure Resource Hierarchy

1. **Management Groups**
    - The highest level, used to organize multiple subscriptions for unified policy and access management.
2. **Subscriptions**
    - Linked under management groups; each subscription holds resources and has its own billing and access controls.  
3. **Resource Groups**
    - Containers within subscriptions that group related resources for easier management.    
4. **Resources**
    - The actual services and components like virtual machines, databases, web apps, etc., that run your applications.

- **Management Groups** > **Subscriptions** > **Resource Groups** > **Resources**

This hierarchy helps organize, manage access, and apply policies efficiently across Azure environments

# Entra ID / Tenants

1. **Entra ID**
	- Formerly known as Azure Active Directory Tenant 
	- It represents the organizationâ€™s identity and access management control in the cloud
2. **Tenants** 
	- Tenant is like a Default / main directory
	- Each tenant has its own users, groups, applications, and policies
	- Tenants are **isolated** from each other, so data and identities are separate and secure

- ***In Simple***
	- In Entra ID Tenant, we have our identities like user , admin , etc and those identities actually access the **Azure resources** that reside in our subscriptions and resource
